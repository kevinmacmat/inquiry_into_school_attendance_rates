An Inquiry into School Attendance Rates
---------------------------------------
This project is an inquiry into the factors affecting student attendance rates for elementary and middle schools in NYC. The data was collected from the annual School Quality report. The data gathered is a collection of questions and statistics with ordinal responses, continuous data, and percentages. I used an linear regression model in order to carry out the analysis. The end of the mod_2_final_notebook.ipyb notebook contains the iterations of models made, before settling on the final, with a small explanation.
